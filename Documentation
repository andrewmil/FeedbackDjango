Requirements:
In order to use this application you need to have the required packages installed.
You can easily install these packages using pip and the given requirements.txt file.
While in your chosen environment run:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Starting the app
To run the app you use the command:
python(3) manage.py runserver yourip:yourport

If the app compiles successfully you will find feedback form at yourip:yourport/polls.

Database Setup:
You can configure django to use your own database by editing the mysite/settings.py file.
By default this application is set to send data to a local postgresql database named feedback2.
In this file you will find a section that looks like,

DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql',
        'NAME': 'feedback2',
        'USER': 'andrew',
        'PASSWORD': 'password',
        'HOST': 'localhost',
        'PORT': '',
    }
}

The attributes that you can assign here are mostly self-explanatory and should be filled in appropriately to match your database configuration.
The ENGINE attribute tells django which kind of database your app will send data to. You can change this by editing the part of the string after backends.
For example for a MySQL database you would have 'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.mysql'. You should be able to find the appropriate string ending for your database through google.
Depending on your choice of database you may have to install extra packages to allow this connection.

Once your configurations are made run:
python(3) manage.py migrate
This will update your databases with the necessary extra tables that django requires.

The form of database required is called feedback2 and contains 1 table called feedback.
The sql query that can create this database in postgresql is given in database.sql
